# invasive_salmonella
This repository contains data and code to accompany our paper on identifying patterns of gene degradation associated with invasiveness in Salmonella. 

It is separated into three directories:
* One for building your own model for identifying genes associated with a phenotype.
* One containing code for the original analysis.
* One containing code to analyse your own Salmonella strains using our model.

See the Wiki page for instructions on building your own random forest model or testing your own Salmonella isolates using our invasiveness index:
